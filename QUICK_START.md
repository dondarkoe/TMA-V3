# TMA Engine OS - Quick Start Guide for Bolt

## üöÄ Get Started in 5 Minutes

This guide will get your TMA Engine OS application running in Bolt with Supabase.

## Step 1: Apply Database Schema (2 minutes)

You need to run SQL commands in your Bolt Supabase instance:

### Option A: Through Bolt Interface
1. Look for "Database" or "Supabase" in your Bolt dashboard
2. Find the SQL Editor or Database Tools
3. Copy and paste each file's contents in order:
   - First: `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`
   - Second: `supabase/migrations/002_rls_policies.sql`
   - Third: `supabase/migrations/003_add_conversations_messages.sql`
4. Execute each one (Click "Run" or "Execute")

### Option B: Direct Supabase Dashboard
If Bolt provides a direct link to Supabase:
1. Click "Open Supabase Dashboard"
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Paste and execute each migration file

**What this does:** Creates all necessary database tables and security rules.

## Step 2: Get Your Service Role Key (1 minute)

1. In Bolt's Supabase settings, find:
   - Project Settings ‚Üí API
   - Or look for "Service Role Key"
2. Copy the service role key
3. Open `.env` file in your project
4. Replace the placeholder on line 3:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=paste_your_actual_key_here
   ```

**What this does:** Allows admin operations and user management to work.

## Step 3: Create Storage Buckets (2 minutes)

In your Supabase Dashboard:

1. **Go to Storage section**
2. **Create two buckets:**

   **Bucket 1: "uploads"**
   - Click "New Bucket"
   - Name: `uploads`
   - Public bucket: Yes (or configure policies)
   - File size limit: 50MB

   **Bucket 2: "private_files"**
   - Click "New Bucket"
   - Name: `private_files`
   - Public bucket: No
   - File size limit: 200MB

**What this does:** Enables file upload features for audio and video.

## Step 4: Test the Application

The dev server should already be running. Open your browser to the application:

### First Test: Dashboard
1. Dashboard should load without errors
2. You should see the TMA OS logo
3. Three engine buttons: KOE, ARK, INDI

### Second Test: Chat
1. Type a message in the chat box
2. Click Send or press Enter
3. MIKKI should respond
4. Message should persist after page refresh

### Third Test: Navigation
1. Click the KOE engine icon
2. KOE page should load
3. Click the ARK engine icon
4. ARK page should load

**‚úÖ Success!** If all three tests pass, your app is working!
